INTRO_TITLE = Willkommen!
INTRO_DESCRIPTION = Welcome to your first day as factory manager! These pop-up windows will help explain the game, but only appear once. There is a 'reset tutorial' button in the options screen if you want to see them again later.
INTRO2_TITLE = Dein Job
INTRO2_DESCRIPTION = As factory manager, your job is to design the factory and manage its finances so that you turn a profit and earn vital income for our beloved shareholders. If you run out of money, you will run out of your own job prospects, so keep an eye on your company cash balance at the top right of the screen.
INTRO3_TITLE = Fabrik Management
INTRO3_DESCRIPTION = Broadly speaking your roles are to place down new production 'slots' and conveyors to manage production, and manage research and pricing. You can also remove old slots and you will find yourself doing a lot of 're-tooling' of your factory layout as you research new methods of production.
ZOOM_TITLE = Zoom
ZOOM_DESCRIPTION = First we will explain how to view your factory. Your can zoom the camera in and out using the mousewheel or the PageUp and PageDown keys on your keyboard.
MOVE_TITLE = Steuerung
MOVE_DESCRIPTION = To move around the map you can click and drag the floor with your mouse, you can use the WASD or arrow keys, or move your mouse cursor to the edges of the screen.
BASICS_TITLE = Placing Slots
BASICS_DESCRIPTION = To get started in your factory you need to place down a whole bunch of production slots, in the right order, and connect them with conveyor belts. Cars move along the production line until they reach an 'export' slot which places them in the showroom for sale.
SLOT_BUTTON_TITLE = Launching the Slot Picker
SLOT_BUTTON_DESCRIPTION = Click this button to launch the 'slot picker' and start laying out your factory.
SLOT_PICKER_TITLE = Slot Placer
SLOT_PICKER_DESCRIPTION = This window shows all of the different options you have for placing new production 'slots' and other facilities within your factory. At the start of the game not all slots will be available as they may need to be researched. Hover over the name of a slot to see more information on how much it costs, how much power it produces and how many employees come with it
SLOT_PICKER2_TITLE = Slot Order
SLOT_PICKER2_DESCRIPTION = The slot picker shows the slots in the order you need to place them, starting with fit chassis and ending in export. The export slot has to be placed on an export socket. The gaps between the slots have to be filled with conveyor belts.
SLOT_CHASSIS_TITLE = Chassis Assemble
SLOT_CHASSIS_DESCRIPTION = The very first slot to place down should probably be the chassis assemble. Click on the highlighted window, then place the slot down in your factory
ON_CHASSIS_PLACE_TITLE = Now the Body!
ON_CHASSIS_PLACE_DESCRIPTION = Good work! Now you need to place down the fit body slot. Make sure its placed somewhere in front of the previous slot (check the arrows). You may want to leave a gap of a few tiles between the two, to allow for later expansion.
ON_FIT_BODY_PLACE_TITLE = Förderbänder!
ON_FIT_BODY_PLACE_DESCRIPTION = To get cars to travel between slots you need to connect them using conveyor belts. Select the conveyor belt tool, then click and drag in the right direction (from chassis to body slot)
RESOURCE_IMPORTER_TITLE = Cancel Conveyor mode
RESOURCE_IMPORTER_DESCRIPTION = Right click anywhere on the screen to cancel the conveyor placing mode, then click next.
RESOURCE_IMPORTER2_TITLE = Rohstoff Importer
RESOURCE_IMPORTER2_DESCRIPTION = As well as being connected by conveyor belts, most production slots will need a connection to the resource network that imports resourcesd to the factory. To get started, zoom out until you see a potential slot for a resource importer and place one down.
RESOURCE_CONVEYOR_TITLE = Rohstoff Förderbänder
RESOURCE_CONVEYOR_DESCRIPTION = You now need to click and drag a connection from that resource importer to the stockpiles at each of your slots. Then you should have a working, running production line!
CAR_STOCK_TITLE = Car Showroom
CAR_STOCK_DESCRIPTION = This is a list of all the cars you have completed construction of, but have not yet sold. Their prices will vary depending on what features each car has. Having an empty showroom suggests your cars are too cheap, whereas having an overstocked showroom suggests you need to lower your prices.
EFFICIENCY_TITLE = Efficiency
EFFICIENCY_DESCRIPTION = This shows various data about the overall efficiency of your factory. In an ideal world, every car would always be currently busy having work done to it, and every production slot would always have a constant throughput of cars. In practice, this is extremely difficult!
CAR_DESIGN_TITLE = Car Model
CAR_DESIGN_DESCRIPTION = The individual car models your factory produces are shown here. Each model can have an enormous number of variations based on which features are included with the vehicle, and all these features are priced individually. Your sales people will automatically match prices to the current market price for each car feature, although you may choose to overrule them here to make cars sell faster or slower.
CAR_DESIGN2_TITLE = Preis Kategorie
CAR_DESIGN2_DESCRIPTION = The current price of the car is shown here, along with the price category it currently falls into. When prices reach certain levels, that category will change, and buyers expectations of what features will come with that car will change also. Do not try to make luxury cars (for example) until you have researched all the features that people will expect.
CAR_DESIGN3_TITLE = Neues Modell
CAR_DESIGN3_DESCRIPTION = You can create different variants of each car (perhaps to have models at each price category) by clicking the new model button. You can also archive old models, which will prevent new ones of that type being produced.
CAR_DESIGN4_TITLE = Design Features
CAR_DESIGN4_DESCRIPTION = These are the features currently researched that you can apply to your car models. Ticking them here ensures that when they get to the right slot on the production line, IF that slot has the upgrade installed, the feature will be added. Obviously features add to the price of the car.
RESEARCH_TITLE = Forschung
RESEARCH_DESCRIPTION = This research screen shows all the different technologies you will need to research to compete in the world of car production! Research costs research points, which are regularly generated by each research facility you have placed. You can only research one tech at a time, and you have to pay the researchers wages even when they do not work, so you should always be working on something!
ACHIEVEMENTS_TITLE = Achievements
ACHIEVEMENTS_DESCRIPTION = Staying in business is obviously your number one concern, but if you want to push your business skills that much further, there are a number of special CEO awards you can qualify for if you reach important company targets. Don't expect much in the way of a bonus if you don't hit these!
IMPORTS_TITLE = Imports
IMPORTS_DESCRIPTION = This screen shows you what resources and components you are importing from third party suppliers outside your factory, and how much you are spending on them. In general, you will be more efficient if you can import just raw materials and manufacture as many components as possible in the factory. Just make sure your car production is fast enough to use up all the components you produce, as you cannot sell them to anybody else.
LOANS_TITLE = Kredite
LOANS_DESCRIPTION = When you get into financial trouble you will find yourself here, taking out a loan. Make sure to take out a loan before you actually run out of cash! Loans all have differing interest rates, terms and amounts so make sure you make the right decision. There is no option to pay these loans off early.
POWERSTATION_TITLE = Power Station
POWERSTATION_DESCRIPTION = You just placed down a power producing facility! The power created will offset your electricity bill, and should be cheaper than buying in power from a utility. You will automatically import and pay for power you still need at the usual cost, but any surplus power you generate can not be sold!
RESEARCH_PLACED_TITLE = Forschungseinrichtung
RESEARCH_PLACED_DESCRIPTION = You just built your first research department! Now we have researchers working for us its time to choose where they should concentrate their efforts. To make research go more rapidly, you might wish to build more and more facilities, if funds allow!
SUPPLY_STOCK_PLACED_TITLE = Nachschublager
SUPPLY_STOCK_PLACED_DESCRIPTION = You just placed your first supply stockpile! These can be used as intermediaries between resource importers (and your own manufacturing slots) and the final destination. Think of them as configurable mini-warehouses ensuring that the production line never runs out of resources triggering a (gasp!) pause in production.
LEVEL_EDITOR_TITLE = Level Editor
LEVEL_EDITOR_DESCRIPTION = The level editor is very much a work in progress! You can create new maps here and save them out under a new name. Note that changing the map size will clear the current map! A map is basically a series of connected zones, with placed-down export and import slots.
SCHEDULER_TITLE = Style Scheduler
SCHEDULER_DESCRIPTION = This is where you determine the production schedule for this slot. Each line is a car body style and a quantity to produce. Once the schedule reaches the bottom it will automatically loop around. You cannot have an empty schedule! (Also note only currently researched body styles will be shown)
AI_RESEARCH_TITLE = Forschung der Mitbewerber
AI_RESEARCH_DESCRIPTION = The pop-up at the bottom right of the screen shows that one of your competitors has done some research. As your rivals research car technologies, they will become less rare and thus less valuable. Try not to fall too far behind.
AI_RESEARCH_UNIVERSAL_TITLE = Universal Feature!
AI_RESEARCH_UNIVERSAL_DESCRIPTION = It looks like the competition have all researched a technology and it has become universal. Customers will now *expect* to see this feature on a car, and if its not present�the sales price of the car will be negatively affected.
SLOT_DETAILS_TITLE = Production Slot Details
SLOT_DETAILS_DESCRIPTION = This window shows detailed information on a car production 'slot'. You will likely click these from time to time to see what is holding up production, or maybe to see what resources are being imported and consumed by this slot. The upgrades tab at the bottom of the window also gives you access to upgrading the capabilities of this slot.
BUY_VEHICLE_UPGRADE_TITLE = Car Upgrade Purchased!
BUY_VEHICLE_UPGRADE_DESCRIPTION = You just purchased an upgrade at one of your slots. This means that the slot has the *capability* to install that upgrade on a car but that does not mean it will do so unless you have also selected that upgrade as one to be fitted to the car in the car design screen.
COMPONENT_PRODUCED_TITLE = Komponenten Produktion!
COMPONENT_PRODUCED_DESCRIPTION = Your manufacturing slots have produced their first 'locally built' component (<COMPONENT>)for use in your vehicles. This should work out to be more efficient than importing everything, but make sure there is a route from the manufacturing slot to where the component will be used.
TECH_AI_ICONS_TITLE = Mitbewerber Forschung
TECH_AI_ICONS_DESCRIPTION = These icons in the corner of a tech show that the competition is now offering this technology in their cars, which will reduce the available price premium. Each symbol represents a different price-band in which the technology is now being made available by your competitors.
